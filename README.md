 Input Method Switch (Linux/Win): SHIFT+DEL

Usage of the Hiragana/Katakana Layers:
- Japanese numerals along top row are 1-10 (いち-十)
- Shift+9, Shift+0 (parens) will create 「」
- Shift+<, Shift+> (square brackets) will create〈〉
- PLACE NUMBERS e.g., 10, 100, 1000 can be written in kanji
     by using the 1e_ syntax (press keys sequentially): 1 -> e -> _
     with _ representing how many zeroes in the number:
- 1e1 -> 十 (10), 1e2 -> 百 (100), 1e8 -> 億
- The only exception: 1e0 -> 〇
     (十 is far more common than 〇, otherwise these would be reversed
      and 〇 would be on the 0 and 1e1 would be 10)
- CHARACTERS e.g., "ha" -> は , "pi" -> ピ
